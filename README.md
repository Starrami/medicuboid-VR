# medicuboid-VR
Medicuboid is the first medical full dive system for people with vision and hearing problem.
Full dive VR is a type of virtual reality experience where one fully "dives in" to the virtual world and becomes disconnected with the actual physical reality.
In Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game,shortly known as VRMMORPG,Amuspheres are used to connect to the virtual world.
Amuspheres transmits sounds and images directly to the brain as well as signal transmission .
It also has sensation canceler.
By sending an electromagnetic pulse to the back of the head,it can temporarily paralyze the nerves;thereby functioning as general anesthesia.
The amusphere can't cancel the pain from the surgery or serious illness so the medicuboid enhances the electromagnetic pulse's output and by filling it on a specialised bed,can cover anything from the brain to the entire spinal column.
It's most important impact is its ability to treat terminally ill patients
